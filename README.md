Title: Horiseon

What it is: 
Horiseon helps you with optimization of search engines, online reputation management and social media marketing.  In this project I made this webpage accessible to people with disabilities.

Requirements
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Project Notes
What I did to HTML: 
1. I changed the added in semantic elements such as header, section, article, footer.
2. I changed the div in header to nav to assist with screen reading.
3. added alt descriptions to the article section
4. made the hero its own section to separate the big picture and descriptions


What I did to CSS:
1. Cleaned up the article & sections to make the sheet easier to read and make adjustments to.
2. Changed the margins of article & section to have 20 px on top & bottom
3. added 20px of padding space around everything to look like the example
