Title: Horiseon

What it is: 
Horiseon helps you with optimization of search engines, online reputation management and social media marketing.  In this project I made this webpage accessible to people with disabilities.

Requirements
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Project Notes
What I did to HTML: 
1. I changed the added in semantic elements such as header, section, article, footer.
2. I changed the div in header to nav to assist with screen reading.


What I did to CSS:
1. Cleaned up the article & section to make the sheet easier to read.
2. Changed the margins of article & section to have 20 px on top & bottom
